<h2><u><i>Software</u></i></h2>
<p align="justify">The Discord client is built on the Electron framework using web technologies, which allows it to be multi-platform and run on personal computers and the web. The software is supported by nine data centers scattered around the world to keep latency with clients low. All versions of the client support the same feature set. The Discord application for personal computers is specifically designed for use while gaming, as it includes features such as low-latency, free voice chat servers for users and a dedicated server infrastructure. Discord's developers plan to add video calling and screen sharing. Direct calling was added in an update on July 28, 2016, with support for calls between two or more users. In December 2016, the company introduced its GameBridge API, which allows game developers to directly support integration with Discord within games. The Git repository documentation for the Discord API is hosted on GitHub.

While the software itself comes at no cost, the developers investigated ways to monetize it, with potential options including paid customization options such as emoji or stickers. In January 2017, the first paid features were released with 'Discord Nitro'. For a monthly subscription fee users can get an animated avatar, use custom emojis across all servers, an increased maximum file size on file uploads (from 8 MB to 50 MB), and a unique profile badge. The developers have claimed that while they will look for ways to monetize the software, it will never lose its core features. Discord uses the Opus audio format, which is low-latency and designed to compress speech.
